    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">
      This Roman-style pizza has a long-fermented thicker crust, and is
      absolutely awesome. Topped with prepared sauce, sausage, sweet peppers,
      and three cheeses, or with whatever you like, you'll want to make this on
      repeat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>4 1/4 cups bread flour (500 grams)</li>
      <li>1 rounded teaspoon dry yeast (3.5 grams)</li>
      <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups prepared pizza sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon
        until almost all flour has disappeared and a rough dough is formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3
        minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off
        spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a
        damp hand, reach under and grab the dough at the edge of the bowl, pull
        it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat
        about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can,
        turning the smoothest side up
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly.
      </li>
